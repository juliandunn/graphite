# Keep in mind the following rules as of Carbon 0.9.10:
#
#    There can be many sections in this file.
#    The sections are applied in order from the top (first) and bottom (last).
#    The patterns are regular expressions, as opposed to the wildcards used in the URL API.
#    The first pattern that matches the metric name is used.
#    This retention is set at the time the first metric is sent.
#    Changing this file will not affect already-created .wsp files. Use whisper-resize.py to change those.
#
# Therefore: "priority" is deprecated. Also, please use the new retention format rather than the confusing
# seconds-per-datapoint:count-of-datapoints format of older Graphites.

# Retention interval for Etsy-and-other style statsds.
[statsd]
pattern = ^stats\.
retentions = 10s:6h,1m:7d,10m:3y

# Retention interval for Carbon itself. Don't care that much so we can throw away the data fairly quickly
[carbon]
pattern = ^carbon\.
retentions = 10s:6h,1m:7d

# Catchall for anything else that doesn't match
[catchall]
pattern = ^.*
retentions = 60s:30d,15m:1y,30m:5y
